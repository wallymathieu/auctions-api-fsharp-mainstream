# Web Api

The Web Api is intentionally simplistic.

- Types : Contains the types that are consumed and returned from the API 
- Jwt : The jwt payload decoding (since a frontproxy or api gateway is supposed to decode the JWT)
- App : The Web Api implementation using Giraffe. Endpoints and their implementation.
